# Dev Platform

We think that python is definitely a good idea for back end which leaves us with django and flask. We think most of the work is front end with data storage on back end and cranking out xml. Django

# How this is going to work

They are each going to see what it looks like with the dance. Then they have some time to fix the programming. 

# Challenges

* Effects
* VLs

# Color

Master show file isn't edited. Color is going to be fixed presets and color

# Timeline

* Users logging in with differnt cues
* Users get to accurately put times with songs
* Users get to put description or data into a table
* Export json to xml

We need a plot ASAP. TRXs on back wall. Rush PARs on electrics. 6 S4 Pars on each electric. 

Must have working prototype by April 1st.
